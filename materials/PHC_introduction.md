## Passive heave compensation

### What is Safelink PHC?

A heave compensator substantially reduces the effect of waves on offshore lifting operations, making the lifting conditions almost as stable as on land.
For oil and gas installations, AHCs were a game changer when they were launched over 20 years ago. Uptimes were significantly increased, installations were safer and, just as importantly, it has meant major cost savings for field developers.
Today, contracting ships for oil and gas installations without an AHC is almost unthinkable. AHCs are also a prerequisite in tenders for installation companies, and extensive savings have been made in terms of time, cost and the environment since their launch.

Safelink has been working on the next generation of AHCs for several years, and once again seems to have developed an industry standard for offshore lifting operations. Safelinkâ€™s technology makes it significantly more cost-effective to build AHCs for the heaviest loads, which means that installation companies working with offshore wind will be able to use the technology at a fraction of the price of conventional systems.
